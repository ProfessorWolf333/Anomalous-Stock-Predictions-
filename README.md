Professional analysts

Rogue quant friends

Family members we trust more than economists

And several powerful sketchballs operating out of the W-TRC basement

It has hit 99%+ accuracy twice, which is, statistically speaking, utterly cursed.
We’re looking into that, but also not too hard, because it works.

:Why This Matters

Complete obliteration of your market enemies allows you to:

Control economic circumstance like it’s a personal playlist

Wear a monocle without irony

Carry cartoon bags of money with dollar signs on them

Drive your business adversaries into something extremely monopoly-adjacent
(But not technically a monopoly—because that’s illegal and we read the rules)

All of this, without lifting a sword. Just math.
Unethical? No. Just… better.
